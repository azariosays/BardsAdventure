CLASS - College of Learning Arts, Skills and Sorcery
        this is what all humans have to go through from age 10 to 18. After years of trainging and test the school will decided at graduation which
        job class best fits the student.

Job Classes:

Bard: The lowest job class one could get. Often the humans that get chosen for this class are teased and rarely taken on adventures or added to a party.
      They use song magic to issue buffs and debuffs that some might say are better off in the hands of white mage.

knight: The most prestigious job class and one that all humans want to be when they graduate CLASS. Knights rely heavely on their attack skill
