Kyokou - the world - this is the name of the world the game takes place in.

Hub Village - town: Alangard (made up name just for refrence) - region: North Kyokou (fictional thing in jap) - This is where graduates of CLASS begin their adventures. Knights rule as the highest ranking job class, then comes magician (black and white), archer, and bard (insert more as needed). Bards are constintantly looking for work in this town since most parties don't wish to include them labling their skills as useless. The town encourages segrigation of classes by giving them seprate buidlings where only people of that class are allowed. Bards are seen crowding the entrance to town begging adventures for work.
The towns building structure is all surrounding a statue of a knight who saved kyokou hundreds of years before(this is just a place holder for something else that could happen, so please add anything you see fit). four roads branch off in verticle and horizontal directions. So from the entrance road, you have a market place, blacksmith, item shop, inn. walking straight through ends up at the statue. right at the statue is the knights road where an entire street is closed off for them. The street across from market road is dedicated to archer and bards who have seprated the road by a line(i guess?). The bards street is the only one accessible from the the beginging of the game. having a bar and a few houses that are able to be entered. from the left of market street is wizards road where it is closed off to everyone but the wizard class and even they have problems with fighting eachother over which is better black or white wizards.
